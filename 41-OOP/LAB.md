# ![cf](http://i.imgur.com/7v5ASc8.png) Lab 40: Django - Django REST Framework

## Django - Django REST Framework

**This is a paired assignment**

### Specifications
- Django Rest Framework provides a full-featured framework for creating RESTful APIs based on the Django models you create. These APIs can then be used to power applications written for mobile devices, Javascript apps in Angular or other MVC frameworks, or even “normal” web apps, replacing the more traditional “view”-based approach to CRUD operations.

- To familiarize yourself with the concept, you’ll walk through [this](http://www.django-rest-framework.org/#tutorial) tutorial provided as part of the framework documentation.

- For this first assignment, please complete the first **three** sections of the tutorial:
    - Serialization
    - Requests and Responses
    - Class-Based Views


### Submission

1. For your submission, please paste screenshots of both the JSON and HTML output of a variety of endpoints from your new api.
2. Use the comment feature in Canvas to submit questions, considerations or comments
