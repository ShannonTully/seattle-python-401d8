# ![cf](http://i.imgur.com/7v5ASc8.png) Class 15: Binary Trees

## Daily Plan
- Notes:
    - Anything top of mind?

- Code Review
- Binary Trees
- Binary Search Trees
- Traversals & Recursion
- Lab Preview

## Learning Objectives
- Students will learn the basic construct and constraints of both Binary Trees, and more specifically Binary Search Trees
- Students will learn the different tree traversal methods; depth-first and breadth-first
- Students will have a general understanding of space and time complexity relating to both traversals and searching

## Outline

- Code Review
- [Binary Trees]
- Traversals
