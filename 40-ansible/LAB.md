# ![cf](http://i.imgur.com/7v5ASc8.png) Lab 40: Automate Deploying Imager with Ansible

## Automate Deploying Imager with Ansible

Repeat the deployment of your Django Imager website using the Ansible Configuration Management System.

**This is a paired assignment**

### Specifications

You will want to spend a fair amount of time looking over the [Ansible documentation](http://docs.ansible.com/), which is pretty well organized.

Remember, the basic form of the command to run an ansible playbook is:

    $ cd <ansible_repo>
    $ ansible-playbook -i <path to hosts file> <path to playbook>.yml

### Submission

Please use the text box in Canvas to submit the following items:
 - A URL pointing to your running Django Instance on AWS
 - The URL of your Ansible Repository in GitHub
 - A Screenshot of the final screen of your terminal session where the ansible playbook was run. This should show the steps run, which were OK, which were changed, etc. (You should be able to embed this screenshot in the text entry box using the little broccoli button in the editor bar.)

Part of our evaluation of this submission will be our ability to sign up for the service, add and edit photos and albums, and use the API to get to our photos. Please ensure that all of this works on AWS.
