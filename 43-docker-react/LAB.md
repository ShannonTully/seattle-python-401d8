## ReactJS - Introduction to Components and State Management

**This is a Solo assignment**

### Specifications

- Create a new repository calls `reddit-search`
- Work in a branch called `react-intro`
- Install your React scaffold using `npx install create-react-app <name of the app>`, and cd into that directory
- Follow the below specification for building a Reddit Search Application:

Create the following components and structure them according to the following diagram
```
App
  SearchForm
  SearchResultList
```
###### App Component
* should contain all of the **application state**
* should contain methods for modifying the application state
* the state should have a topics array for holding the results of the search

###### SearchForm Component
* should contain a text input for the user to supply a reddit board to look up
* should contain a number input for the user to limit the number of results to return
  * the number must be more than 0 and less than 100
  * `onSubmit` the form should make a request to reddit
  * it should make a get request to `https://www.reddit.com/r/${this.state.searchFormBoard}.json?limit=${this.state.searchFormLimit}`
    - _Note: `www` is **required** for the api call to complete successfully._
  * on success it should pass the results to the application state
  * on failure it should add a class to the form called error and turn the form's inputs borders red

###### SearchResultList Component
* Should inherit all search results through props
* This component does not need to have its own state
* If there are topics in the application state it should display an unordered list
* Each list item in the unordered list should contain the following
  * an anchor tag with a href to the topic.url
    * inside the anchor a heading tag with the topic.title
    * inside the anchor a p tag with the number of topic.ups
